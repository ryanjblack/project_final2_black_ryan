## Resources

Stuff I used on this project:

- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) for stock textures

- [Cupcake Ipsum](http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/#/paragraphs/5/length/medium/with_love/false/start_with_cupcake/false/seed/2e32e03373f85601b4298af30bcba2e37b5f5d5a6728f53572b97a570a0dbb9b) for fun placeholder text

Otherwise :
> â€œI did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment."

## Deductions

> I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments

I will keep working on finding a way to get my vision of torn paper (see the tile) to work on a responsive level for the final product. Perhaps I will have to use a few different sizes of images and media queries to have the tears look fluid on a webpage.
